# To-do-list
This is just a simple to do list that has used html, some css and Php as a backend language. No javascript included.
Create a database todo_list with a table called *tasks* and assign three columns which are *id*, *task_text* and *completed* as shown
CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    task_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    completed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);
Make sure that mysql and apache are properly installed.
GOOD LUCK!
